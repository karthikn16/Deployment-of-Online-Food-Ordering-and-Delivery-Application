# Deployment-of-Online-Food-Ordering-and-Delivery-Application
Zomato is a leading online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. To handle
increasing user demand and improve deployment efficiency, the company is transitioning from
a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture using DevOps practices.
The goal is to implement a CI/CD pipeline, containerized deployments, and real-time monitoring to ensure high availability, faster releases, and automated scalability. AWS will be used as the primary cloud provider for hosting and deployment.
